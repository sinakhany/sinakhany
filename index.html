<p>Hello, dear ones.<br>
    I am Sina Khani, a student of Shahid Motahari School of Education.<br> I am from the city of Qanat, Qanoot and Qanat. The city of Yazd is a very pleasant city and very old,<br> I suggest you to visit this ancient city, which is also the old city of Iran.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Perhaps now the question has arisen in your mind why the city of Yazd is considered<br> a pure destination for Iranian and non-Iranian tourists.<br> And for example, why foreign tourists choose the original<br> and spectacular city of Yazd as their travel destination from<br> among all these cities and visit the attractions of this city!<br> Do not doubt that smart, professional and curious tourists must have<br> found unrivaled attractions in the city of Yazd, and for this reason,<br> they prefer this ancient and historical city to other cities in the world. Some of the most important reasons<br> for choosing Yazd as a pure destination for travel and entertainment are as follows<br>; In fact, we can say about the city of Yazd:<br>
    The first city of all the beautiful and spectacular cities of Iran that achieved world registration is Yazd.<br>
    Religious minorities live in the city of Yazd and enjoy active religious sites.<br>
    Places, ceremonies and relics of Zoroastrians can be seen in abundance in this vast province.<br>
